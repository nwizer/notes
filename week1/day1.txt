The Story of Tim Berners-Lee and the Creation of HTTP and HTML

The Problem (1980s):

At CERN, scientists struggled to share research efficiently.
Existing methods like email and isolated databases were cumbersome.

➔ Tim’s Vision:

Create a universal, interconnected system to share knowledge seamlessly.

The Proposal (1989)

Tim wrote "Information Management: A Proposal" at CERN.
Key Idea: Use hypertext to link documents across computers, forming a "web" of information.

Building the Web
➔ HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
A language to structure content for web pages.
Allowed text, links, images, and headings to be displayed in a navigable format.

➔ HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):
A set of rules enabling communication between computers.
Ensured web pages could be requested and delivered efficiently.

First Web Tools (1990):
Tim created:
CERN httpd: The first web server.
WorldWideWeb: The first browser.
The first website: http://info.cern.ch, hosted at CERN.

The Breakthrough (1991–1993):
➔ August 6, 1991:
The world’s first website went live, explaining the web and how to use it.
➔ 1993:
CERN released the web’s code for free, making it open to all.
